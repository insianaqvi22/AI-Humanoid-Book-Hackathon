# AI-Humanoid-Robotics Book Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Technical Accuracy (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All information related to humanoid robotics, artificial intelligence, sensors, actuators, control systems, and human-robot interaction must be correct and based on reliable sources or established engineering practices; All technical claims must be verifiable through textbooks, academic research, official documentation, or reputable industry sources; Code examples, pseudocode, algorithms, and equations must be correct and clearly explained.

### II. Clarity for Learners
The book must be written for students, beginners, and early-stage engineers with basic knowledge of programming or engineering; Concepts must progress from foundational ideas to more advanced topics in a clear and logical order; Content must balance theory with practical explanations, simplified models, examples, and step-by-step descriptions to support learning and application.

### III. Spec-Driven Writing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All chapters, sections, diagrams, and examples must strictly follow the specifications defined using Spec-Kit Plus; No content may be written outside an approved specification; All content changes must be reflected in the corresponding specifications before implementation; TDD mandatory: Specifications written → User approved → Content gaps identified → Then implement content.

### IV. Human-Centered Robotics Focus
The book must focus on humanoid robots designed to interact safely and effectively with humans; Content must include perception, locomotion, manipulation, ethics, and safety considerations; All robot design and behavior discussions must prioritize human safety and interaction effectiveness; Responsible AI, safety, and ethical considerations must be addressed where relevant.

### V. Educational Value and Practical Application
Content must have clear educational purpose with practical applications; All concepts must be accompanied by examples, diagrams, or step-by-step explanations that support learning and application; Terminology and writing style must remain consistent across the entire book; Content must be structured for effective learning progression.

### VI. Quality and Consistency Standards
All factual and technical claims must be verifiable through reliable sources; Content must follow Markdown format compatible with Docusaurus; Structure must be organized into clear chapters and sections suitable for sidebar navigation; Writing tone must remain educational and professional throughout.

## Additional Constraints and Standards

Technology stack requirements: Markdown files compatible with Docusaurus; Deployment on GitHub Pages; Scope limited to humanoid robotics and enabling technologies such as mechanical design, sensors, actuators, control systems, artificial intelligence, and human-robot interaction; Content must be fact-checked against established engineering practices.

## Development Workflow and Review Process

Code review requirements for all content changes; All technical content must be verified against reliable sources; Content must follow approved specifications; All chapters and sections must pass educational quality checks; Final approval requires verification of technical accuracy and educational value.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other practices and guides the development of the AI-Humanoid-Robotics Book; All PRs/reviews must verify compliance with technical accuracy, educational clarity, and specification adherence; Content complexity must be justified for the target audience level; Use specifications and guidelines for all development decisions.
