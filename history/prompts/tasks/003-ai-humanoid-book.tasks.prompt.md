# AI Humanoid Robotics Book Tasks

## User Input

```
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Response Summary

Generated comprehensive implementation tasks for the AI Humanoid Robotics book based on the specification and implementation plan. The tasks are organized into 8 phases:

1. **Phase 1**: Setup tasks for project initialization
2. **Phase 2**: Foundational tasks for core infrastructure
3. **Phase 3**: User Story 1 - Physical AI Student Learning Core Concepts (P1)
4. **Phase 4**: User Story 2 - Hands-on Simulation Learning with Gazebo & Unity (P2)
5. **Phase 5**: User Story 3 - Advanced Perception and Navigation with NVIDIA Isaac (P3)
6. **Phase 6**: User Story 4 - Vision-Language-Action Integration for Cognitive Control (P4)
7. **Phase 7**: User Story 5 - Capstone Autonomous Humanoid Implementation (P5)
8. **Phase 8**: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

The tasks follow the required checklist format with proper Task IDs, story labels, and file paths. Each user story phase contains independently testable increments that align with the acceptance scenarios defined in the specification. The implementation strategy follows an MVP approach focusing on User Story 1 as the minimum viable book.

## Outcome

Created 86 specific, actionable tasks in the proper format that can be executed by an LLM without additional context. Tasks are organized by user story priority, include proper dependencies, and provide parallel execution opportunities. The tasks cover the complete four-module curriculum structure with simulation-first methodology and Docusaurus-based documentation delivery.
